Akagi - a simple http server based on ReactPHP
----------------------------------------------


This is what the common Hello World example looks like:

  use Akagi\Server;
  use Apix\Log\Logger\Stream as Logger;
  use React\Http\Response;

  $logger = new Logger('php://stderr', 'a');
  $server = new Server([], $logger);

  $server->routePattern('GET','.*',function ($request,$matches=[]) {
      return new Response(
            200,
            array('Content-Type' => 'text/plain'),
	    "Hello world\n"
      );
  });
				
  $server->run();
